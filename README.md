## Description

_This app allows the user to create stores and shoes. When a store is added, it populates a table on the index, same with the shoes. When viewing individual stores you can select the shoes you would like to add via checkboxes on that stores page. The user can also edit the store name as well as delete the store. When viewing shoe_information, the user will see a list of all the stores that currently sell that shoe._
